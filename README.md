<h1>iNERGIE</h1>

During my last year of high school, we were tasked with creating a project to showcase our skills. My classmates decided to create electrical spots for charging phones. For my part, I developed an app to monitor the status of these spots, manage faults, and schedule tasks for technicians.

One of the key features of the app is a Pareto chart, which is extremely useful for technicians. It helps them identify the most common faults in the system, enabling them to prioritize upgrades and improvements effectively.

Although I developed the app quickly and the code isn't as clean as I would like, I thoroughly enjoyed the process. That is what matters the most!
